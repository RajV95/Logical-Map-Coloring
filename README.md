# Logical Map Coloring using Predicate Logic

## Overview
This repository contains a logical framework for solving the map coloring problem using predicate logic. The map coloring problem is a classic problem in graph theory and computer science, where the goal is to color the regions of a map in such a way that no two adjacent regions have the same color. In this project, we utilize predicate logic to define constraints and rules for the map coloring problem.

## Contents
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the logical map coloring solver.
- `examples/`: Provides examples of maps encoded using predicate logic and their corresponding solutions.
- `README.md`: You're currently reading this file, which serves as an introduction and guide to the repository.

## Dependencies
The project requires an environment that supports logic programming with predicate logic. Depending on your choice of implementation language and tools, you may need the following dependencies:
- [Pytholog](https://pypi.org/project/pytholog/): Logic programming in Python.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
3. Run the logical map coloring solver on your desired map examples, providing the necessary input files or data.
